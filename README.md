Inlinino is an open-source software data logger for oceanographers. It primarily log measurements from optical instruments deployed on research vessels during month long campaigns. Secondarily, it  provides real-time visualization, which helps users troubleshoot instruments in the field and ensure collection of quality data. Inlinino is designed to interface with either serial (RS-232) or analog instruments. The data received is logged in a timestamped raw format (as communicated by the instrument) or in a comma separated file (csv) for easy importation in data analysis software. Typically, a new log file is created every hour for simplicity of post-processing and easy backups. Instruments supported are: SeaBird TSG, Satlantic PAR, WET Labs ECO sensors (e.g. ECO-BB3, ECO-FLBBCD, ECO-BBFL2, ECO-3X1M, ECO-BB9, ECO-BBRT), WET Labs ACS, Sequoia LISST, and analog sensors through a data acquisition system (DataQ DI-1100 ). Other instruments can be added via the user interface if they output simple ascii data frame, otherwise the code is intended to be modular to support new instruments.

### Installation
Inlinino was bundled into a Windows executable and a macOS application. Both are available for download with a quick start guide in the [documentation](https://inlinino.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick_start.html). Otherwise Inlinino can be installed from source using the setup.py file available on this repository, following the instructions below.

Download Inlinino code.
 
    wget https://github.com/OceanOptics/Inlinino/archive/master.zip
    unzip master.zip
    cd Inlinino-master
 
We recommend setting Inlinino in a virtual environment (e.g. miniconda). To set up a new python virtual environment with conda and install Inlinino:

    conda create --name inlinino python=3.8
    source activate inlinino
    pip install -e .

Inlinino can then be started with the following commands.

    python -m inlinino

### Inlinino Software
The application is written in PythonÂ 3, on top of pySerial, numpy, and PyQt5. The current version works with a "classic" Graphical User Interface. A web interface started to be implemented and can be found in the branch `tb-app` of this repository. A command line interface used to be available but was not ported to version >2.0.

The code is organized in:
  + `docs`: User Documentation ([ReadTheDocs](https://inlinino.readthedocs.io/))
  + `inlinino`: Inlinino source code
    - `instruments/`:  Instrument interfaces, more instrument types can be added there.
    - `ressources/`: User Interface Layout and Logo.
    - `*.py`: Core code of Inlinino.
    - `inlinino_cfg.json`: Applications parameters are saved in this file ([ReadTheDocs](https://inlinino.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cfg.html))
  + `mcu_firmwares`: Firmwares to upload on a microcontroller for the previous DAQ module (deprecated)
    - `PASC.cpp`: Precision analog to serial converter (PASC) firmware
    - `Simulino.cpp `: Instrument simulator to test Inlinino with microcontrollers simulating the behavior of scientific instruments.
  + `make.py`: Bundles Inlinino application into a .app or .exe depending on platform. pyInstaller must be installed.
  + `setup.py`: Python environment setup file.

When Inlinino is started an engineering log file is created in `logs/inlinino_<YYYYMMDD>_<hhmmss>.log` and keep track of most tasks executed (e.g. user interaction, creation of data log files, warnings, and potential errors).
